# Project4-LinearRegressionMachineLearning
Machine Learning Project which uses Linear Regression
Build a model that predicts the estimate of price 

-	First take a dataset from Kaggle and create a machine learning model
-	Concepts such as data cleaning, feature engineering, one hot encoding, dimensionality reduction , outlier detection 
-	The model built is then  exported to a pickle file 
-	Then it is hosted on python flask server which can consume the pickle file and expose http endpoints for various requests 

Python for programming language, Pandas for data cleaning, Matplotlib for data visualization, python flask for backend server and html,css and javascript for our backend website
